# Bank Customer Segmentation
Customer segmentation is extremely useful for any business. By grouping your customers based on their shared characteristics and behaviors, you can tailor your marketing efforts to suit their needs and preferences.

In this project, we are going to perform customer segmentation for an anonymized real Bank published by Prof. Hofmann.

Notice: This is a mock project but uses real data and therefore is a real-life data science scenario.
